Welcome to The Euphoria Project™

I am a beginner develoer practicing my Front-end development skills (I have been learning HTML and CSS for 2-3 months). 
This is my first webpage that i have created, no im not joking (excluding 'hello world' type webpages to learn basic CSS principles 🥱).

I wll be adding to this project freequently as i gain further knowledge of HTML, CSS and javascript, until a finalised working webapp and userflow is inplace.

This project is all created from hand made web design by me, predesigned in figma by me, clothing items designed by me, page formatting and ideas by me and branding is all done by me.
NO AI HAS BEEN USED OR ABUSED MAKING THIS PROJECT, everything has been researched, brainstormed, interpreted, visualised and put together by me and me only.

This project could potentially help launch The Euphoria Project™ brand and influence future branded webstores upon release.

Please do not steal any content that is featured within this project as it is all owned and created by me.
